# Development stuff: The Fairy Tale REVAMPED

This repository just contains some config files, data files and even some source code for quick tools I needed to create the current version of The Fairy Tale REVAMPED.

This data is only offered here for evaluation purposes. You may clone this repository onto your system for evaluation purposes only.
Since this stuff is not part of the game itself (which has [its own repository here](https://github.com/PhantasarProductions/The-Fairy-Tale-REVAMPED-for-Apollo)) I put it in this repository. However issues are mostly only taken from the game's repository rather than this one. 

This is just a nice "look into my kitchen" as we say in Dutch, when it comes to the background work I gotta do to get things working.
